# BerdinskiyBear's Armor HUD
Minecraft mod that adds a HUD widget that shows your current armor items.


This mod adds a minimalistic vanilla-like widget that shows your armor items and a warning if durability is low enough.
While other mods expect the player to look at numbers all over the screen, this mod allows to see your armor items
in a vanilla-style minimalistic widget without extra text or numbers. Position and other parameters of the widget
can be adjusted in a configuration file.


This mod is made for [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use/ "Fabric").
If [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api "Fabric API") is installed,
one can reload the config same way as resource packs.
If [Mod Menu](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modmenu "Mod Menu")
and [Cloth Config API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config "Cloth Config API") is installed,
then one can configure this mod using a config screen accessible through mods menu.
